Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

QUESTION: Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

ANS: Software Engineering is an engineering branch related to evolution of software products using well defined scientific principles, techniques and procedures.

It helps in creating apps, games and websites that make our lives easier

Helps to solve real world problem through technology 

Helps to write instructions for computers known as code

Through the internet, it has made communication easier 


QUESTION: Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1:Rise of Structured Programming- It emphasizes modularity and readability 

2:Object-Oriented Programming - Revolutionized software design and development leading to modular and reusable code

3: Internet- Lead to the creation of web application and services

QUESTION: List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1:Planning- You first have to define the project, identify what's needed and the time the project will take.

2: Requirement Analysis- you have to know what is needed for the project to work without any problem along the way

3: Design - structure, user-interface are designed by the requirements that have been gathered

4:Coding: This brings the project to life by use of a language that the computer understand to execute commands and design the project how you want it to look like.

5:Testing- Testing is done to make sure there is no bug and the running of the program is smooth

6: Deployment: When the testing has been done and everything is good, you can now upload it for people to use or try out

QUESTION: Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
WATERFALL METHODOLOGY- Waterfall Methodology is whereby software development follows a linear sequence of events
This type of methodology can be used in building projects, manufacturing a product, 

AGILE METHODOLOGY- Agile methodology prioritizes collaboration, continuous delivery and feedback.
It can be used in software development, creating web application, consulting and finance

QUESTION: Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer- Use programming skills to create software.

Quality Assurance Engineer- Identifies bugs, system flaws and other software issues in a product before it's released to the public.

Project Manager- Supervises the development process and it's market entry by generating ideas for market entry, manage pricing policy, plan and control task 

QUESTION: Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments(IDEs) encourages standardization, improves code accuracy, boost developer productivity, decrease installation time and accelerate development activities by keeping developers informed of the most current threats. Example is AWS cloud9 and CodeLite

Version Control Systems-it efficiently manages and tracks changes to code over time, facilitating team collaboration and project progress tracking. Example is Git and Mercurial


QUESTION: What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Dealing with large complex codebases 

Rapid technology advancement, this can be oercomed by adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.

Time constraints,it can be solved by adopting agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints

Software Testing Conflicts,use of  open communication, collaborative planning, and clear role definitions are essential to mitigating these issues and ensuring a smooth development process

Changing Software Requirements, use of strategies like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components help engineers respond effectively to evolving requirements while maintaining high-quality outcomes


QUESTION: Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing-consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. Unit tests are generally quite cheap to automate and can run very quickly by a continuous integration server

Integration testing- can be testing the interaction with the database or making sure that microservices work together as expected

Acceptance testing-verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


QUESTION: Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering-  it's designing and optimizing prompts to guide AI models to produce certain results.
it makes AI applications more effective and efficient. such as AI bots
Prompt engineers link the gap between end users and the LLM making it easier for the AI to understand what they are requested to do 

QUESTION: Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Report- What is the best movie to watch?
Improved Report- Can you suggest a thriller movie with Tyller Perrie as the cast?

The improved Report is more effective because it mentiones the movie genre and the name of the cast
