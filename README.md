# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

QUESTION: Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
ANS: Software Engineering is an engineering branch related to evolution of software products using well defined scientific principles, techniques and procedures.
It helps in creating apps, games and websites that make our lives easier
Helps to solve real world problem through technology 
Helps to write instructions for computers known as code
Through the internet, it has made communication easier 


QUESTION: Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1:Rise of Structured Programming- It emphasizes modularity and readability 
2:Object-Oriented Programming - Revolutionized software design and development leading to modular and reusable code
3: Internet- Lead to the creation of web application and services

QUESTION: List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1:Planning- You first have to define the project, identify what's needed and the time the project will take.
2: Requirement Analysis- you have to know what is needed for the project to work without any problem along the way
3: Design - structure, user-interface are designed by the requirements that have been gathered
4:Coding: This brings the project to life by use of a language that the computer understand to execute commands and design the project how you want it to look like.
5:Testing- Testing is done to make sure there is no bug and the running of the program is smooth
6: Deployment: When the testing has been done and everything is good, you can now upload it for people to use or try out

QUESTION: Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
WATERFALL METHODOLOGY- 

AGILE METHODOLOGY-

QUESTION: Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


QUESTION: Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


QUESTION: What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


QUESTION: Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


QUESTION: Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


QUESTION: Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
